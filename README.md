# Combining UHPLC Profiling and Random Walk Network-Based *In Vitro* Analysis to Predict Herb-Induced Liver Injury 

Title: **Combining UHPLC Profiling and Random Walk Network-Based *In Vitro* Analysis to Predict Herb-Induced Liver Injury**

Authors: *Kwanyong Choi, Jun Young Park, Sunyong Yoo, Soo-yeon Park, Hyoung-Yun Han, Ji Yeon Kim*

## Description

We present a study on predicting compound-induced hepatotoxicity

Our method utilizes the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm to propagate each compound’s impact through the human protein–protein interaction network and infer pathway-level scores

We provide the code and data needed to reproduce the *in silico* workflow described in the manuscript

For raw data on compounds, genes, and phenotypes, please contact us by email
